# forth-http
A small web server written to get more practice with Forth.

I was originally planning on writing an assembler and emulator for the 
Little Man Computer (LMC), but I found out that I suck at writing Forth.
So, that project idea will get used with a different language.

Rather than spend multiple weeks trying to get better at Forth, I decided
to just make something small and fun so I could move on.


## Summary

- Client sends requests for a file
- Server responds with file if it exists, otherwise sends 404 page
- Yeah, that's it
